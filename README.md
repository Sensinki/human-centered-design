## :memo: Research question

How can I design and develop an interface for Nicolette that makes it easy for her to scroll and copy/paste within 3 weeks?

## :page_with_curl: Problem definition

With her mobility limitations, Nicolette faces unique challenges in navigating the digital realm. While she embraces speech software and a drawing tablet, tasks like copying and pasting text remain a challenge without shortcuts or right-click options. As a former geologist and nature enthusiast deeply engaged in community endeavors, Nicolette seeks a user-friendly solution that integrates seamlessly with her preferred tools. A prototype that enables effortless text manipulation through speech commands and intuitive gestures on her tablet would not only enhance her digital experience but also amplify her contributions to her community and passion for nature.

Nicolette sees this hover state of the paragraph by hovering the mouse over it. And copying the paragraph by clicking it into the clipboard.

Via the buttons on the bottom right corner Nicolette can increase or decrease the size of the font and scroll up and down.
