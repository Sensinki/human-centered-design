                    <h2>What is Archaeology?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Archaeology is the study of the human past using material remains. These remains can be any
                        objects that
                        people created, modified, or used. Portable remains are usually called artifacts. Artifacts
                        include
                        tools, clothing, and decorations. Non-portable remains, such as pyramids or post-holes, are
                        called
                        features.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Archaeologists use artifacts and features to learn how people lived in specific times and
                        places. They want
                        to know what these people's daily lives were like, how they were governed, how they interacted
                        with each other, and what they believed and valued. Sometimes, artifacts and features provide
                        the only
                        clues about an ancient community or civilization. Prehistoric civilizations did not leave behind
                        written
                        records, so we cannot read about them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Archaeology is based on the scientific method. Archaeologists ask questions and develop
                        hypotheses. They use evidence to
                        choose a dig site, then use scientific sampling techniques to select where on the site to dig.
                        They observe, record,
                        categorize, and interpret what they find. Then they share their results with other scientists
                        and the public.

                    <h2>What is Philosophy?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Quite literally, the term "philosophy" means, "love of wisdom." In a broad sense, philosophy is
                        an activity people undertake when they seek to understand fundamental truths about themselves,
                        the world in which they live, and their relationships to the world and to each other. As an
                        academic discipline philosophy is much the same.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Those who study philosophy are perpetually engaged in asking, answering, and arguing for their
                        answers
                        to lifeâ€™s most basic questions. To make such a pursuit more systematic academic philosophy is
                        traditionally divided into major areas of study.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What often motivates the study of philosophy is not merely the answers or arguments themselves
                        but whether or not the
                        arguments are good and the answers are true.

                    <h2>What is Psychology?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Psychology is the study of mind and behavior. Its subject matter includes the behavior of
                        humans and nonhumans, both
                        conscious and unconscious phenomena, and mental processes such as thoughts, feelings, and
                        motives. Psychology is an
                        academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the natural and social
                        sciences.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Biological
                        psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline
                        to neuroscience. As
                        social scientists, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health
                        problems, it is also
                        directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By
                        many accounts, psychology
                        ultimately aims to benefit society.

                    <h2>What is Ecology?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Ecology is the study of organisms and how they interact with the environment around them. An
                        ecologist studies the
                        relationship between living things and their habitats.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In order to research the environment, scientists ask questions, such as: How do organisms
                        interact with the living and
                        nonliving factors around them? What do organisms need to survive and thrive in their current
                        environments? To find the
                        answers to these questions, ecologists must study and observe all forms of life and their
                        ecosystems throughout our
                        world.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Human activity plays an important role in the health of ecosystems all around the world.
                        Pollution emitted from fossil
                        fuels or factories can contaminate the food supply for a species, potentially changing an entire
                        food web.
