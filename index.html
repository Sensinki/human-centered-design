                    <h2>What is Archaeology?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Archaeology is the study of the human past using material remains. These remains can be any
                        objects that
                        people created, modified, or used. Portable remains are usually called artifacts. Artifacts
                        include
                        tools, clothing, and decorations. Non-portable remains, such as pyramids or post-holes, are
                        called
                        features.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Archaeologists use artifacts and features to learn how people lived in specific times and
                        places. They want
                        to know what these people's daily lives were like, how they were governed, how they interacted
                        with each other, and what they believed and valued. Sometimes, artifacts and features provide
                        the only
                        clues about an ancient community or civilization. Prehistoric civilizations did not leave behind
                        written records, so we cannot read about them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Archaeology is based on the scientific method. Archaeologists ask questions and develop
                        hypotheses. They use evidence to
                        choose a dig site, then use scientific sampling techniques to select where on the site to dig.
                        They observe, record,
                        categorize, and interpret what they find. Then they share their results with other scientists
                        and the public.

                    <h2>What is Philosophy?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Quite literally, the term "philosophy" means, "love of wisdom." In a broad sense, philosophy is
                        an activity people undertake when they seek to understand fundamental truths about themselves,
                        the world in which they live, and their relationships to the world and to each other. As an
                        academic discipline philosophy is much the same.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The study of ethics often concerns what we ought to do and what it would be best to do. In
                        struggling with this issue,
                        larger questions about what is good and right arise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Those who study philosophy are perpetually engaged in asking, answering, and arguing for their
                        answers
                        to life is most basic questions. To make such a pursuit more systematic academic philosophy is
                        traditionally divided into major areas of study.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What often motivates the study of philosophy is not merely the answers or arguments themselves
                        but whether or not the
                        arguments are good and the answers are true.

                    <h2>What is Psychology?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Psychology is the study of mind and behavior. Its subject matter includes the behavior of
                        humans and nonhumans, both
                        conscious and unconscious phenomena, and mental processes such as thoughts, feelings, and
                        motives. Psychology is an
                        academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the natural and social
                        sciences.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Biological
                        psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline
                        to neuroscience. As
                        social scientists, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Psychologists are involved in research on perception, cognition, attention, emotion,
                        intelligence, subjective
                        experiences, motivation, brain functioning, and personality. Psychologists' interests extend to
                        interpersonal
                        relationships, psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas within social
                        psychology. They also consider
                        the unconscious mind.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health
                        problems, it is also
                        directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By
                        many accounts, psychology
                        ultimately aims to benefit society.

                    <h2>What is Ecology?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Ecology is the study of organisms and how they interact with the environment around them. An
                        ecologist studies the
                        relationship between living things and their habitats.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In order to research the environment, scientists ask questions, such as: How do organisms
                        interact with the living and
                        nonliving factors around them? What do organisms need to survive and thrive in their current
                        environments? To find the
                        answers to these questions, ecologists must study and observe all forms of life and their
                        ecosystems throughout our
                        world.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Human activity plays an important role in the health of ecosystems all around the world.
                        Pollution emitted from fossil
                        fuels or factories can contaminate the food supply for a species, potentially changing an entire
                        food web.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition to examining how ecosystems function, ecologists study what happens when ecosystems
                        do not function normally. Changes in ecosystems can result from many different factors including
                        diseases among the organisms living in the area, increases in temperature, and increased human
                        activities.

                    <h2>What is Geologie?</h2>

                    <p>
                        The word geology means 'Study of the Earth'.
                        Also known as geoscience or earth science, Geology is the primary Earth science and looks at how
                        the earth formed, its structure and composition, and the types of processes acting on it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Geology is concerned with the history of the earth over the course of its 4.5 billion year life.
                        By studying the structures of the earth we can unlock its hidden past and anticipate its future.
                        Geology describes the structure of the Earth on and beneath its surface and the processes that
                        have shaped that structure. Geologists study the mineralogical composition of rocks in order to
                        get insight into their history of formation.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Geology determines the relative ages of rocks found at a given location; geochemistry (a branch
                        of geology) determines their absolute ages. By combining various petrological,
                        crystallographic, and paleontological tools, geologists are
                        able to chronicle the geological history of the Earth as a whole. One aspect is to demonstrate
                        the age of the Earth. Geology provides evidence for plate tectonics, the evolutionary history of
                        life, and the Earth's past climates.
