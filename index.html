            Archaeology is the study of the human past using material remains. These remains can be any objects that
            people created, modified, or used. Portable remains are usually called artifacts. Artifacts include tools, 
            clothing, and decorations. Non-portable remains, such as pyramids or post-holes, are called features.
        </p>

        <p>
            Archaeologists use artifacts and features to learn how people lived in specific times and places. They want
            to know what these people's daily lives were like, how they were governed, how they interacted with each
            other, and what they believed and valued. Sometimes, artifacts and features provide the only clues about an 
            ancient community or civilization. Prehistoric civilizations did not leave behind written records, so we 
            cannot read about them.

            Understanding why ancient cultures built the giant stone circles at Stonehenge, England, for instance, remains a
            challenge 5,000 years after the first monoliths were erected. Archaeologists studying Stonehenge do not have ancient
            manuscripts to tell them how cultures used the feature. They rely on the enormous stones themselvesâ€”how they are
            arranged and the way the site developed over time.

            Most cultures with writing systems leave written records that archaeologists consult and study. Some of the most
            valuable written records are everyday items, such as shopping lists and tax forms. Latin, the language of ancient Rome,
            helps archaeologists understand artifacts and features discovered in parts of the Roman Empire. The use of Latin shows
            how far the empire's influence extended, and the records themselves can tell archaeologists what foods were available in
            an area, how much they cost, and what buildings belonged to families or businesses.
